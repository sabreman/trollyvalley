Trolly Valley

(c) 2003-2010 Mikko Kein√§nen

Trolly Valley is an arcade adventure game for Commodore 64. I started learning 6502
Assembly language in 2003 by programming this game. Well, at first I started by
studying some book that I alredy purchased in the 1980's.

I haven't continued this actively since I started to study Computer Science in
2004. I did  some improvements in 2007 and released a preview version in CSDB.
I did more improvements in 2009 and released a second enchanced preview
version in CSDB. Now, in late 2010 I'm having a fever, and the cure is to do
some assembler hacking on the 6502!
