Trolly Valley

Trolly Valley is an arcade adventure game for Commodore 64. I started learning 6502
Assembly language in 2003 by programming this game. Well, at first I started by
studying some book that I alredy purchased in the 1980's.

I haven't continued this actively since I started to study Computer Science in
2004. I did  some improvements in 2007 and released a preview version in CSDb.
I did more improvements in 2009 and released a second enchanced preview
version in CSDb. Now, in late 2010 I'm having a fever, and the only cure is to do
some assembler hacking on the 6502!

I would like already to thank all those encouraging comments from some 
sceners at CSDb (bugjam, Jammer, ...), Lauri, laama and others. 

The project can be compiled, written to disk image and run using the provided buildnrun bash script. The script requires a Linux operating system and the following tools installed in the $PATH:
